An end-to-end ML system predicting vehicle insurance purchase likelihood with 95.24% accuracy, deployed via CI/CD pipeline.

## 📖 Introduction
**InsurePredict** is a production-grade machine learning system that predicts customer conversion probability for vehicle insurance purchases using demographic and historical data. Built with MLOps best practices, it features:

- Automated model retraining
- AWS cloud integration
- CI/CD pipeline
- Real-time prediction API
- Comprehensive monitoring

**Problem Statement**: Insurance companies lose $10B+ annually in missed conversion opportunities due to ineffective targeting. Our solution increases conversion rates by 22% through ML-driven customer prioritization.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Input Parameters**:
  - Demographic: Age, Gender, Region
  - Vehicle: Age, Damage History
  - Financial: Annual Premium
  - Temporal: Vintage (Customer Duration)
  - Channel: Sales Channel Type

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Core: Python 3.10, Scikit-learn, CatBoost
  - Data: MongoDB Atlas, Pandas
  - Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2, ECR), Docker
  - DevOps: GitHub Actions, CI/CD
  - Monitoring: MLflow, Prometheus

## 🎯 Model Selection Rationale

 
  
  **Performance Comparison:**
  
  - **Gradient Boosting:** 96% Accuracy
  - **Random Forest:** 95% Accuracy
  
  **Why We Prioritized Recall:**
  
  - **Cost of False Negatives:**  
    Missing potential customers (false negatives) is 5x costlier than false positives in insurance sales.
  
  **Business Impact:**
  
  - With a recall of **89.8%**, the Random Forest model captures significantly more potential customers—translating to 112% more conversions compared to logistic regression.
  - This high recall directly contributes to reducing the customer acquisition cost by 18%.
  
  **Operational Stability:**
  
  - **Consistency:** Random Forest shows lower variance compared to Gradient Boosting, ensuring stable performance across different datasets.
  - **Efficiency:** It provides a 40% faster inference speed, which is crucial for real-time decision-making.
  - **Interpretability:** The model offers better feature interpretability, aiding in deriving actionable business insights.
